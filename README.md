This project leverages machine learning to automate and optimize resource planning and task scheduling for Agile software development teams. By analyzing historical task data, team velocity, and member availability, the model intelligently recommends task assignments and sprint schedules that improve overall efficiency.

Designed for Agile environments such as Scrum or Kanban, this tool aims to support better planning decisions and workload distribution.

⚙️ Built as part of a group project for our academic minor specialization, combining concepts from ML, operations research, and Agile methodologies.
